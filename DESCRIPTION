Title: A 'Deque' Container for R
Version: 1.1-0
Description: A 'deque' is a list or vector-like data structure.  These are
    meant to be very cheap to insert new objects intoHowever,
    unlike R's list structure, data put into a 'deque' is not necessarily
    stored contiguously, making insertions and deletions at the front/end
    of the structure much faster.  The implementation here is new and
    uses a doubly linked list, and whence does not rely on R's
    environments.  To avoid unnecessary data copying, most 'deque'
    operations are performed via side-effects.
