Package: dequer
Type: Package
Title: An R Deque Container
Version: 1.0
Description: This package offers special data structure called a 'deque'
    (pronounced like 'deck'), which is a list-like structure.  However,
    unlike R's list structure, data put into a 'deque' is not necessarily
    stored continuously, making insertions and deletions very fast.  The 
    implementation here is new and uses a doubly linked list, and whence
    does not rely on R's environments.  To avoid unnecessary data copying,
    most deque operations are not safe to use with parallel operations.
