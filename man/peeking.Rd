\usage{
peek(x, n = 1L)

\method{peek}{deque}(x, n)

\method{peek}{stack}(x, n)

peekback(x, n = 1L)

\method{peekback}{deque}(x, n)

\method{peekback}{queue}(x, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A deque or a stack.}

\item{n}{The number of items to view.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{NULL}; sub-elements are only printed.
}
\description{
These methods are side-effect free. Note that unlike R's \code{head()} and
\code{tail()}, the sub-objects are not actually created. They are merely
printed.
}
\details{
View items from the front/back of a deque or a stack, for \code{peek()} or
or \code{peekback()}, respectively. Similar to \code{head()} and \code{tail()}.
}
\examples{
library(dequer)
d <- deque()
push(d, 1)
push(d, 2)
peek(d)
